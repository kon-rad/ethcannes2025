## CRITICAL RULE: Command Execution

**NEVER run any terminal commands automatically.** Instead:
1. Show the command to the user
2. Explain what the command does
3. Let the user decide whether to run it
4. Only proceed after the user confirms they've run the command

Example:
```bash
# Run this command to install dependencies:
npm install wagmi viem @wagmi/core

# Run this command to start the development server:
npm run dev
```

This ensures the user maintains full control over their system and can review commands before execution.
